//! Sandboxes by lease: one live handle per durable lease, shared by every
//! holder, fenced only during crash recovery.
//!
//! A container sandbox lives as long as the lease that names its workspace.
//! The coordinator allocates the lease and hands it to each execution that
//! runs in the sandbox; this manager keeps the one live handle and a holder
//! count. A second acquire on a live lease — a restarted execution, an
//! inherited nested invocation, concurrent scopes over one workspace —
//! reuses the handle and never stops the sandbox. Per-execution release only
//! drops a holder. The sandbox is stopped when its invocation releases the
//! lease and kept or deleted by retention; `petri sandbox prune` deletes
//! kept ones later.
//!
//! # Recovery
//!
//! When no live holder exists — a fresh process over a run dir, or a plugin
//! generation change that invalidated every old handle — acquire
//! reconciles: it lists the provider by the workspace label, attaches the
//! one recorded match, stops it once (ending whatever a dead execution or a
//! dead plugin left running), and starts it once before any holder resumes.
//! More than one match is an error, never an arbitrary choice; a confirmed
//! record whose resource is missing is an error, never a silent replacement,
//! because its workspace was lost. A create happens only when reconciliation
//! finds nothing.
//!
//! # The ledger
//!
//! Every transition is written to a [`LeaseLedger`] before the provider call
//! that makes it true (`allocating` before create, `pending: stop` before
//! stop, `pending: delete` before delete) and confirmed only after the
//! provider succeeds. Recovery repeats a pending idempotent operation. The
//! coordinator's resource store is the durable ledger; a standalone driver
//! uses an in-memory one and releases its sandbox at scope release.
