//! The command line.
//!
//! `check <workflow>` parses, lowers and validates a workflow file — including
//! the step registry, so an unknown step kind or a bad literal config is caught
//! here — and prints every diagnostic with its span. `run` runs one to
//! completion and writes the event log beside the workspaces. `replay` feeds a
//! saved log back through the engine and checks byte-identity — the determinism
//! canary, runnable from the shell.
//!
//! This crate names no format. It is the command line over whatever
//! [`Runtime`] it is handed: [`main`] takes a factory and calls it once per
//! command, so the binary that ships — and any other binary — decides which
//! frontends and step kinds are registered. Anything a format needs from its
//! host comes from the frontend itself — where its repository root is, and the
//! run parameters a run would otherwise have to hard-code — so no command here
//! has a special case for one format.
