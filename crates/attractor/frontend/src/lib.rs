//! The Attractor frontend: Graphviz DOT workflows → HIR.
//!
//! Text in, `Graph` and diagnostics out, exactly as the GitHub Actions
//! frontend. The reference implementation (Fabro) renders templates,
//! resolves `@file` references and applies its model stylesheet once at run
//! creation and persists the literal graph; this frontend does the same at
//! load, so what the engine sees is literal.
//!
//! This crate lowers the language alone. It reads no settings file: a host
//! frontend that has one (Fabro's `workflow.toml` and its settings layers,
//! `frontend_fabro`) resolves it into a [`RunSettings`] and calls [`lower`].
//! [`Attractor`] is the bare frontend, with default settings.
//!
//! What lowers where:
