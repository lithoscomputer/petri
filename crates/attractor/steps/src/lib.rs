//! Fabro step kinds: what a lowered Fabro graph runs.
//!
//! The frontend names six kinds (`frontend_attractor::kinds`); this crate
//! registers them. [`register`] installs the real steps — `attractor/command`,
//! `attractor/wait`, `attractor/human`, `attractor/agent` over ACP or native
//! Pebble, `attractor/prompt` and `attractor/workflow` — and [`register_stubs`]
//! installs one simulated step per name (Fabro's `--dry-run` handlers) so a
//! graph lowers, validates and runs end to end with no model, shell or person.
//! Which registry a run uses is the distribution's choice.
//!
//! [`register`] also installs the run's output-reference store
//! ([`blobs::OutputStore`], a [`blobs::LocalBlobStore`] under
//! `<run_dir>/blobs`) unless the host registered its own before the run,
//! and the admission pass that pins every LLM node's model at
//! `Runtime::check` when the runtime has a catalog ([`admission`]).
