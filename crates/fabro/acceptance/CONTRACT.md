# The Fabro execution compatibility contract

This page freezes what Petri promises for Fabro workflows, against one Fabro
revision, for one declared set of complete workflow bundles. It is the
contract the black box battery and the differential comparison test against.
`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md` says how each construct lowers and
`crates/fabro/FORMAT.md` how each settings section resolves; this page says which
constructs the required bundles use, and whether each one is supported, a
tracked defect, an accepted migration, or an explicit exclusion.

## Reference revision

| What | Value |
|---|---|
| Fabro repository | `fabro-sh/fabro` |
| Reference commit | `05ebd0fd1beec214b558f4b478e36bd08b507dc7` (committed 2026-09-13T14:42Z) |
| Where it lives | `main` (the merge of fabro-sh/fabro#867) |
| Pin file | `crates/fabro/corpus-pin.txt` (no `# ref:` line: the commit is on `main`) |
| Fabro version string | `fabro 0.355.0-nightly.0 (05ebd0f ...)` |
| Fixtures | `crates/fabro/oracle/expected/*.json`, each with `fabro_commit` equal to the pin |

Rules:

- `scripts/corpus-fetch-fabro.sh` fetches the pinned commit. When the remote
  refuses a bare SHA it fetches the `# ref:` and fails unless that ref still
  resolves to the pin.
- `crates/fabro/acceptance/tests/routing.rs` rejects a fixture whose
  `fabro_commit` differs from the pin. Fixtures and parity runs always use one
  reference version.
- `scripts/oracle-regenerate.sh` builds `fabro` from the fetched checkout into
  `crates/fabro/corpus/fabro-target/` and drives it as a subprocess. The
  harness checks the binary reports the pinned short SHA. A `fabro` on `PATH`
  is never used.
- Petri never links a Fabro crate. `crates/petri/lib/tests/fabro_dependencies.rs`
  scans the full `cargo metadata` resolve graph, every dependency kind, and
  nested manifests and build scripts. `crates/petri/cli/tests/standalone.rs`
  runs the shipped binary with no `fabro` on `PATH`.

## The parity harness

`crates/fabro/oracle/harness/` runs the shared oracle cases through the pinned
Fabro binary and public interfaces only:

| Need | Public interface used |
|---|---|
| A Fabro server | `fabro server start --foreground --no-web --bind 127.0.0.1:<port> --storage-dir <dir> --config <settings.toml>`, dev-token auth, `[environments.local] provider = "local"` |
| Run creation | `fabro run --detach --environment local --provider openai --json <file>` in a fresh git repository; a fake `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret satisfies default model selection and is never called |
| Scripted agent and prompt stages | `backend="acp"`, `acp.command` launching `scripted_acp_agent.py`; the agent's text ends with Fabro's routing directive JSON (`outcome`, `failure_reason`, `preferred_next_label`, `suggested_next_ids`, `context_updates`) |
| Scripted human gates | `GET /api/v1/runs/{id}/questions`, `POST /api/v1/runs/{id}/questions/{qid}/answer` with `{"kind":"selected","option_key":...}` |
| A stage that asks for a retry | a human gate with `timeout="2s"` and no `human.default_choice`; Fabro's handler returns `retry_classify`, the only public path to `retry_requested` |
| Observation | `fabro events <run>` (JSON lines: `stage.completed`, `stage.failed` with `will_retry`, `loop.restart`, `run.completed`, `checkpoint.completed` with `context_values`) |

Cases that a public interface cannot reproduce exactly are recorded in the
fixture's `harness.realization` map so a reviewer can see which node ran as an
ACP agent and which as a human gate. The old in-process generator that linked
`fabro-workflow` is deleted.

## The differential matrix

Black box phase 5 (`crates/fabro/acceptance/DIFFERENTIAL.md`). Every
scenario under `crates/fabro/acceptance/scenarios/` runs through the shipped
`petri` binary and through the pinned Fabro binary
(`scripts/fabro-provision.sh`, never `PATH`'s `fabro`) with the same bundle,
inputs, provider twins and interview script, each engine in its own
workspace, server and twin namespace. The Fabro adapter
(`crates/petri/cli/tests/support/fabro/fabro_adapter.rs`) uses the same
public interfaces as the parity harness plus `fabro validate --json`,
`fabro dump` and `GET /api/v1/runs/{id}/state`, redirects Fabro's providers
through `[llm.providers.<id>] base_url` in its private `settings.toml`, and
answers gates through the questions API with `yes`, `no`, `selected`,
`multi_selected` and `text`.

Comparison rules (`support/fabro/compare.rs`): terminal status; the main
stage path in order; each fork's branch envelopes in dispatch order and the
causal order inside each branch, with exact counts; the workflow-owned
context key by key with named bookkeeping kept beside it; artifacts byte
for byte; interviews; provider requests (provider, model, effort, matched
twin scenario) with Fabro's platform requests listed apart; side-effect
counts. Only generated ids, the working directory and blob references are
normalized, through an explicit identity map. Each scenario asserts its
independent expectation on both engines first; a pinned-Fabro violation is
a recorded baseline defect, never permission for Petri to match it.

A difference is accepted only by a decision record in
`crates/fabro/acceptance/decisions/` (format in its `README.md`) that names
the difference kind and the scenario scope. The committed reference of a
scenario (`fabro-reference/reference.json`) is the baseline the live Fabro
run must reproduce; `PETRI_FABRO_REFERENCE_RECORD=1` is the only way to
refresh it. `crates/fabro/acceptance/tests/reference_version.rs` checks
every fixture, reference, capture, decision and evidence record against the
pin. `mise run test:fabro:differential` runs the matrix.

Cells captured live from the pinned binary: `parallel-results` (commands,
two fan-outs), `interview` (the required bundle, five gate kinds and the
summary prompt node), `edit-and-verify` (a native agent with a real shell
tool and a gate), `fallback-failover` (task 12's capture: a 503 after a
completed tool effect and the fall back to Anthropic), `skills-precedence`
(task 14's capture: the three skill directories, the reference prompt
section and `use_skill` tool, the repository's copy winning). Baseline defects of
the pinned Fabro found by the matrix: none at `05ebd0fd`. The previous pin
(`b6482910`) repeated a completed tool effect on failover, recorded as
`fallback-repeated-tool-effect` with the failed assertion under
`known_defects`; since fabro-sh/fabro runs an agent stage's failover inside
Pebble, the live cell shows the append running once, the assertion passes on
both engines, and the record is retired. The five cells
are required cells of `scenarios/matrix.json` (backend `host`, the engine's
agent, `test` naming the `fabro_differential` test), satisfied by the engine
records the tests write.

## Required bundles

`crates/fabro/acceptance/bundles.lock.json` (schema version 1) is the
replacement set. Every bundle's files are vendored in this repository under
`crates/fabro/acceptance/bundles/<id>/<path>` (the file's path in its source
repository), copied once from the source at the locked revision;
`crates/fabro/acceptance/bundles/PROVENANCE.md` records the copy and the
sources' license files. The lock keeps each source's repository, revision,
working-tree state, and every file's mode, size, and SHA-256, with
`vendored: true` on the source. `scripts/corpus-fetch-fabro-bundles.sh`
(`mise run check:bundles`, in the routine gate and in every CI job) verifies
the tracked tree against those digests and fails on a missing, changed, or
extra file; it fetches nothing. The two private sources needed no deploy key
after this: CI reads only this repository.

| Bundle | Source and revision | Status | Scenario obligations |
|---|---|---|---|
| `code-review` | `lithoscomputer/code-review` `0c81ffb4f68039ca56842ab3328fde03b9714350` (private source, vendored; HEAD, clean) | required | empty diff; findings in multiple branches; no surviving findings; invalid output repaired; repair exhausted; one failed branch; reverse branch completion; multi-level fan-out |
| `security-review` | `lithoscomputer/security-review` `c14279e9cdac4f7553b5e010718ada1a76e5c1f8` (public source, vendored; HEAD, clean) | required | no vulnerabilities; several verified; rejected candidate; partial branch failure; malformed response; timeout and cancel |
| `fix-ci` | `veniceai/factory` `1b50f791ac4811aad62788c2a4282a75d1e92422` (internal source, vendored; bundle files match HEAD, other files in that working tree were dirty) | excluded (owner decision 2026-09-07) | none; see below |
| `implement-issue` (with `implement-plan`) | `fabro-sh/fabro` at the pin (public source, vendored) | required | child runs (host and Docker); input and model inheritance; multiple manager cycles; stop condition; child failure; parent cancellation |
| `interview` | `fabro-sh/fabro` at the pin (public source, vendored) | required | scripted choice, refusal, free text; repeated and concurrent questions; child interviews; delayed and withheld reply; invalid, unexpected and unused answers; timeout and cancel; terminal EOF |

"Blocked" names a required bundle whose scenarios cannot run yet. The
blockers are listed per bundle in the lock file. They are not exclusions.

`fix-ci` is excluded by an owner decision of 2026-09-07: `fix_ci.py` resolves
its target through `api.github.com` and clones `veniceai/interface`, and its
setup step needs yarn 4.12.0 through corepack with no network, so a
deterministic run needs a scripted stand-in for the GitHub API and an
offline-installable Node target. The owner judged that overkill. The repair
loop's behavior that does not depend on GitHub is covered elsewhere: a real
deterministic check driving a repair loop until it passes, with the visit
totals surviving the return to the retry target, is `routing/goal-gate-restart-and-visit-limit`;
a provider failure, an exhausted retry budget, a hanging request and a
cancellation are the `provider-faults` family; a failing stage's policy is
`routing/failure-policy`. What stays uncovered is the bundle's own GitHub
target resolution and its `publish` step's single push after success. The
bundle keeps its provenance in `bundles.lock.json` with
`status: "excluded"` and the reason, so the decision is visible and
reversible.

### Inventory and classification

The discovery scan covered `~/p/` with these exclusions: `node_modules`,
`target`, `.git`, `.cargo`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`. It found 6,727
`.fabro` and `.dot` files with 332 distinct contents. Every file has a
location class and a content class (evidence file: task1 review). Summary:

| Class | Files | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Fabro repository checkouts, worktrees and backups (`~/p/fabro-sh/*`) | 5,842 | the pinned corpus covers them; other checkouts are duplicates of other revisions |
| Petri corpus mirrors and probe evidence | 251 | ignored: fetched data and review artefacts |
| Foreman and Conveyor scratch (run dumps, smoke graphs, release repairs) | 241 | generated or stale; excluded |
| Conveyor and its worktrees (`.fabro/workflows/*`) | 137 | valid Fabro variants of the canonical review bundles and Conveyor-only workflows; not in the first set |
| Attractor-era and third-party Attractor implementations | 439 | legacy Attractor; expected `unsupported.legacy_dialect` rejections or unrelated |
| Ordinary Graphviz | 6 | excluded |
| `veniceai/factory` workflows other than fix-ci | 9 | valid Fabro; later candidates |
| Canonical review bundles, fix-ci, corpus implement and interview | required set above | |

## Feature matrix

Every construct the required bundles use, with its disposition. "Supported"
means lowering and execution exist and are tested today. "Tracked defect"
names the task in `.ai/plans/fabro-unified-task-list.md` that owns the fix.

### Graph and node constructs

| Feature | Used by | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `Mdiamond` start, `Msquare` exit, `rankdir`, `label` | all | supported |
| `parallelogram` command with `script`, `timeout`, `output_schema="routing"`, `stdin_source` | code-review, security-review, fix-ci, implement-plan | supported |
| `stdin_source="context.internal.run_id"` | code-review, security-review | supported: `kv` carries the run id |
| `stdin_source="context.parallel.results"` | code-review, security-review | supported: the fan-in publishes `parallel.results` (`id, index, item_label, status, context_updates` in branch order) and `parallel.branch_count`; `context_updates` is the branch target's own outcome updates followed by the public diff against the fork snapshot, the diff winning a duplicate key, and never merges into the parent (`crates/fabro/acceptance/scenarios/parallel-results/CONTRACT.md`, black box `parallel_*` and `for_each_*`) |
| agent node (`prompt`, `@prompts/*.j2`, `{% include %}`) | all but fix-ci commands | supported |
| `output_schema="@schemas/*.json"`, `output_retries` | code-review, security-review | supported |
| `on_failure="route"`, `"exit"` (node and graph) | code-review, security-review | supported |
| `on_failure="succeed"` | code-review, security-review | supported with Fabro's promotion order: a failure an explicit route matches stays failed, an unmatched failure is promoted and reports `succeeded` (oracle cases `succeed_*`); the same order applies to the last retryable failure once `max_retries` is spent (acceptance `exhaustion.rs`) |
| `max_retries`, `default_max_retries` | code-review, security-review, implement-plan | supported |
| `allow_partial=true` | none of the bundles | supported: the exhausted retry is a partial success before any route is considered, as Fabro finalizes it (oracle cases `retries_exhausted_allow_partial`, `allow_partial_at_one_attempt`) |
| `component` with `for_each`, `max_parallel`, `tripleoctagon` fan-in | code-review, security-review | supported: each branch is a child invocation from the fork snapshot, `max_parallel` is one slot per attempt (missing or invalid is 4, zero is 1, a branch in backoff holds none), static and `for_each` branches share the fan-in, empty lists join with no model call (`crates/attractor/steps/tests/parallel.rs`, `crates/core/execution/tests/admission.rs`) |
| `class` with `model_stylesheet` (including `{% set %}`, `{% if %}`, `inputs.*`) | code-review, security-review, implement-issue | supported |
| `default_fidelity`, `fidelity="truncate"`, `fidelity="summary:high"`, `thread_id`, `default_thread` | code-review, security-review, implement-issue, interview | supported: Fabro's preambles for every mode, resolution edge, node, graph, `compact`; threads resolved edge, node, graph, class, previous node, retained on the native backend at `full` (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "Fidelity and threads") |
| `project_memory=false` | code-review, security-review | supported: a prompt node reads no instruction files; agents read Fabro's per-profile files from the Git root to the working directory |
| Sub-agents (`spawn_agent`, `send_input`, `wait`, `close_agent` on native agents) | any bundle's agent may delegate | supported: every `backend="api"` agent has Pebble's sub-agent tools, as every API-backend agent has Fabro's; children share the scope, model and tool hooks, never the question tool; results, failure, cancellation, shutdown order and event identities match the reference (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "Native Pebble"); differences below |
| `stall_timeout` | code-review, security-review | supported: the stall watchdog (default 30 m, `0s` disables); a pending question parks it |
| `loop_restart_signature_limit`, `loop_restart` circuit breaker | fix-ci, implement-plan | supported: default 3, minimum 1, restart edges admit only `transient_infra`, counts survive restart and resume |
| `human.default_choice`, `review_target`, human gate `timeout` | interview | supported: expiry takes the default choice or Fabro's retry outcome; the review target is validated and shown |
| `goal_gate`, `retry_target` (graph and node), `max_visits`, `max_node_visits` | fix-ci, implement-plan | supported |
| `house` manager loop, `stack.child_workflow`, `manager.max_cycles` | implement-issue | supported: one child per manager attempt at one durable call site, Fabro's 45 s poll and `max_cycles` normalization, stop condition at each poll, cancellation and failure propagation (`crates/attractor/steps/tests/manager.rs`, `crates/fabro/acceptance/tests/workflow.rs`) |
| `hexagon` human gate, `question_type` (`yes_no`, `confirmation`, `multiple_choice`, `multi_select`, `freeform`), accelerator labels, `freeform=true` edge | interview | supported; a `multi_select` answer is `Answer::choices` (Fabro's `multi_selected` `option_keys`), the first key routes and every key and label is recorded |
| `tab` prompt node | interview | supported: `attractor/prompt`, one tool-free `lithos-llm` call with the output contract and repair turns; ACP is refused as Fabro refuses it (`crates/attractor/steps/tests/prompt.rs`, black box `a_prompt_node_makes_one_tool_free_model_call`) |
| `model`, `provider`, `reasoning_effort` on nodes | fix-ci, implement-plan | supported for `backend="api"` and prompt nodes; `provider="openrouter"` resolves through the catalog to OpenAI's chat completions protocol, which the OpenAI twin serves (black box `run_model_defaults_reach_openrouter_through_chat_completions`) |
| Conditions: `outcome=succeeded`, `outcome!=succeeded`, `context.K=V`, `&&` | all | supported (`!=` is in the grammar: `conditions.rs`, `holds("outcome!=failed", …)`) |
| `{{ inputs.* }}` in `goal`, `script`, prompts | code-review, security-review, fix-ci | supported; `[run.inputs]` defaults are read |
| `import` placeholders | none of the bundles; corpus and docs | supported at load with Fabro's prefixing, boundary rules, inherited defaults, class propagation, retry-target rewriting, nesting and cycle rejection (`lowering.rs`, black box `an_import_is_expanded_at_load_and_its_nodes_run_under_the_prefix`) |
| Output values above 100 KiB | code-review, security-review (large command output) | supported: the `OutputStore` capability with the local blob store; durable `blob://sha256/…` references, logical reads through `stdin_source` and prompts (`steps.rs`, `large_command_output_is_offloaded_and_reads_back_logically`) |

### `workflow.toml`

Fabro parses `workflow.toml` with the same schema as `settings.toml` and
`project.toml` (`lib/foundation/fabro-config/src/layers/settings.rs`).
Top-level keys are `_version`, `project`, `workflow`, `environments`, `run`,
`cli`, `server`, `llm`; anything else is a hard error. Nested tables use
`deny_unknown_fields`. Precedence, highest first: CLI overrides, `workflow.toml`,
`.fabro/project.toml`, `~/.fabro/settings.toml`, server defaults, built-in
defaults. `[run.inputs]` replaces wholesale across layers; `--input` wins per
key.

Petri acts on `[workflow] graph`, `[run.inputs]`, `[run] goal`,
`[run.model]`, `[run.execution]`, `[run.environment]` with `[environments.*]`,
and `[run.prepare]`. Every other section is diagnosed at load
(`crates/fabro/frontend/src/workflow_toml.rs`) under the readiness
plan's item 1 rule: a platform-only option that has no effect warns
(`ignored.workflow_toml.<section>`, with why); a feature essential to the
requested work fails with a specific `unsupported.workflow_toml.<section>`
error before any node runs; a key Fabro's own parser refuses is
`unsupported.workflow_toml.key` with Fabro's rename hint. Nothing is dropped
silently. The whole file is validated before `[run.prepare]` runs. The
disposition column below is what `petri check` and `petri run` do today;
"tracked" names the task that implements the option, at which point its
diagnostic goes away.

| Section and options | Effect in Fabro | Petri disposition today |
|---|---|---|
| `_version` (`1`) | schema version | supported: any other value is `unsupported.workflow_toml.version`; the legacy `version` key is `unsupported.workflow_toml.key` |
| `[workflow]` `name`, `description`, `graph`, `metadata`, `engine` | `graph` names the entry point; `engine` (`"petri"` or `"legacy"`) picks the engine Fabro runs the workflow on | supported: `graph` selects the file; `engine` is not inspected, Petri is the engine; the rest is metadata. Any other `[workflow]` key is `unsupported.workflow_toml.key` |
| `[run]` `goal` (string or `{file}`), `working_dir`, `metadata` | goal text, local cwd | `goal`: supported, the run goal over the graph's own `goal` attribute, which is the default (as Fabro's run materialization orders them, since 2026-09-21; before, the graph attribute won); `petri run --goal` (the `petri.launch_goal` variable, which a host binds to its run's resolved goal) sits above it; `working_dir`, `metadata`: warn (platform-only) |
| `[run.inputs]` | `{{ inputs.* }}` defaults | supported |
| `[run.model]` `provider`, `name`, `controls.reasoning_effort`, `controls.speed` | default model and request controls | supported: the defaults an LLM node gets below the graph's `default_model` / `default_provider`; `controls.speed` is the default `speed` |
| `[run.model.fallbacks]` `"<model>" = [ "provider:model", ... ]` | model fallback chain | supported: chains keyed by the canonical requested model, resolved against the runner's catalog and available providers with Fabro's notices, reasoning effort mapped per target (`NoNearbyReasoningLevel`, `ChainEmpty`); resolved at `Runtime::check` when the runner has a model client and frozen on the node's config as its plan, as Fabro pins models at run creation (a table the catalog cannot resolve rejects the workflow at load); a provider-local model error (`lithos-llm`'s `failover_eligible`, the rule Pebble applies) moves a native agent or prompt stage to the next target, the conversation kept; on an agent node Pebble runs the chain from the plan's routes and Petri mirrors its events; see "Model resolution at admission" and "Model fallback" in `crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`. Used by code-review and security-review |
| `[run.prepare]` `steps[].script`/`command`/`env`, `timeout` (default 5m) | runs before the first node | supported: lowered as command nodes `run_prepare_N` between `start` and its successors, in the selected environment, with the step `env`, the section `timeout` and `on_failure="exit"`; exactly one of `script`/`command` per step (else `unsupported.workflow_toml.run.prepare`) |
| `[run.execution]` `mode` (`normal`, `dry_run`), `approval` (`prompt`, `auto`) | dry run and auto approve | supported as launch defaults (`Graph.params["fabro.launch"]`, read by the CLI); `--dry-run`, `--auto-approve`, `--interactive`, `--interview-script` win. A dry run touches no provider (since 2026-09-21): every scope is acquired on the simulated provider whatever `[run.environment]` selects, no sandbox plugin is needed, and the scope records name the provider `simulated` (`petri-cli::dry_run_cli`, the corpus sweep included) |
| `[run.environment]` `id`, `image`, `resources`, `network`, `lifecycle`, `labels`, `env` and `[environments.<id>]` `provider` (`local`, `docker`, `daytona`), `image.docker`, `image.dockerfile` (inline or `{path}`), `resources`, `network`, `lifecycle`, `labels`, `env` | sandbox selection | supported: `provider` selects the backend when `--backend` is absent (`local` host, `docker` Docker plugin, `daytona` Daytona plugin; a dry run selects none and needs no plugin); `image.docker` is the scope's container image under `docker` and `daytona` (under `local` it warns `ignored.workflow_toml.environments.<id>.image`, as Fabro ignores it on the host); `env` is the scope environment, with `{{ secrets.NAME }}` a `$secret` reference resolved at spawn from `PETRI_SECRET_NAME` (a missing secret fails the command `secret_unavailable`); `resources` size a Daytona runner. Both tables are read from every settings layer and merge key by key (the settings layer under the project under the workflow, since 2026-09-18), so a host's environment catalog in the settings layer serves a bundle that names an id it does not declare; `petri run --environment <id>` (the `petri.launch_environment` variable) selects the id over every layer, as `fabro run --environment` does. An `id` no layer declares, or an unknown provider, is an error. `cwd`, `network`, `lifecycle`, `labels`, `image.dockerfile` are the platform's keys: known, read by nothing, silent in every layer (since 2026-09-19; the runner builds no image). `resources` under `local` or `docker` warn `ignored.workflow_toml.environments.<id>.resources`; a key outside Fabro's table warns `ignored.workflow_toml.environments.<id>.<key>` |
| `[run.agent]` `fabro_tools` | run-management tools for agents | explicit exclusion: platform-only, warn `ignored.workflow_toml.run.agent.fabro_tools` when `true` |
| `[run.agent]` `skills` | refused: `[run.agent]` denies unknown keys; skills come from `$FABRO_HOME/skills`, `<root>/.fabro/skills`, `<root>/skills` (`fabro-agent/src/skills.rs`) | a Petri extension (accepted difference below): a list of extra directories searched after Fabro's three, warned `fabro.petri_extension`; any other shape is `unsupported.workflow_toml.run.agent.skills`. Fabro's three directories, their order and precedence are implemented for native agents (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "Skills"; fixtures `testdata/skills`) |
| `[run.agent]` `compaction` | refused: `[run.agent]` denies unknown keys; compaction is always on with hardcoded values (`fabro-agent`'s `SessionOptions`: 80 percent trigger, six preserved turns) | refused `unsupported.workflow_toml.key`, with a message naming the values in force; those values are lowered onto every agent node and run through Pebble's automatic compaction (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "Compaction") |
| `[run.agent.mcps.<name>]` `type` (`http`, `stdio`, `sandbox`) with `url`, `headers`, `protocol`, `script`, `command`, `env`, `port`, `startup_timeout`, `tool_timeout`, `enabled`; or `id` | MCP servers for agent sessions | supported: every inline field with Fabro's rules and defaults, merged across the settings, project and workflow layers by name (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "MCP servers"); stdio servers on Petri's host, http servers from the host, sandbox servers in the scope's environment, reached through the provider's preview URL (the host's loopback, the Docker plugin's port forward, Daytona's preview link); `protocol` on http and sandbox servers with Fabro's two values, `streamable_http` (the default) and `sse` (an SSE sandbox server's stream at `/sse` under the route, as Fabro reaches it); tools registered with Pebble under `mcp__<server>__<tool>` and run through the normal tool path, hooks included; `id` (a catalog reference) resolves against the catalog an embedding host binds (`fabro.mcp_catalog_toml`, since 2026-09-18), as the server resolves it, and is refused by the standalone runner, which binds none (`unsupported.workflow_toml.run.agent.mcps.reference`); explicit exclusion: a secret token outside a whole `env`/`headers` value (`unsupported.workflow_toml.run.agent.mcps.secret`); `{{ env.* }}` is an error as in Fabro. The decision record `mcp-catalog-and-transports` accepts no comparison difference for the refused forms, so a scenario that uses one needs its own scoped evidence; implementing the secret form would be a deliberate revision of that record |
| `[[run.hooks]]` `id`, `name`, `event`, `matcher`, `blocking`, `timeout`, `sandbox`, and one of `script`/`command`, `url`+`headers`+`tls`, `prompt`+`model`, `agent="enabled"`+`prompt`+`model`+`max_tool_rounds` | local hooks | supported: every field, transport and event, merged with `.fabro/project.toml` and the host's settings layer by `id`, run by the local hook service with Fabro's matching, decisions, placement and timeouts (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "Hooks"); an agent hook's `max_tool_rounds` is enforced as Pebble's tool-round budget, failing open on exhaustion as the reference's loop does (`hooks::agent_hook_tool_rounds_are_a_hard_bound_that_fails_open`); a layer that cannot be read is an error, so a configured hook is never skipped silently; `checkpoint_saved` warns and does not run (accepted difference below); `stage_retrying` is dispatched (the reference never fires it) |
| `[run.checkpoint]` `exclude_globs`, `skip_git_hooks`, `commit_timeout` | Git checkpoints | explicit exclusion: platform Git; warn `ignored.workflow_toml.run.checkpoint` |
| `[run.clone]` `enabled`, `depth`, `sparse` | server clone depth and cone | supported (task 17): the root `start` stage checks the repository the run was loaded from out into the workspace at `depth` commits (default 100, `0` full), on the host and in a container through the executor; a non-empty `sparse` checks out only those directories and the root's files (Git cone mode); `enabled = false` starts empty. Difference: the clone is of the local checkout at `HEAD`, not a fetch from the remote, and `origin` is the checkout's own `origin` |

in the lock file.

## Tracked departures to retire

None. The matrix (task 18) found one, since retired:

- **The interview bundle needed a `[run.model]` default**
  (`interview-run-model-migration`, retired). `petri run --provider` and
  `--model` now choose the model over the graph and the `[run.model]`
  layers, below a model a node names itself, as the pinned Fabro's launch
  layer sits above `workflow.toml`; `--provider` alone runs the provider's
  catalog default (`gpt-5.6-sol` for `openai`), as `fabro run --provider`
  does. The interview cell runs the unchanged bundle with `--provider openai`
  on both engines, and
  `fabro_blackbox::the_unchanged_interview_bundle_runs_with_a_launch_provider`
  runs it against the twin.

Resolved by the matrix (Petri fixed, no departure): a `yes_no` or
`confirmation` gate records `yes`/`no` under `human.gate.<node>.answer` as
Fabro does, and a freeform answer sets `human.gate.label`.

Retired with the sandbox-driver re-pin (`a225832`): **command output gained
a final newline**. The plugin's exec path was byte-exact all along; the
newline came from Petri's line pump, which now records whether the process
terminated each line (`LogLine::terminated`), and the command step joins the
lines accordingly, so `command.output` is the script's output byte for byte
(`printf 'a\nb'` yields `a\nb`). The `command-output-trailing-newline`
record is deleted; the differential cells pass with `petri == fabro`
exactly, and a recurrence is reported as an unresolved
`value.trailing_newline` difference.

Retired with review finding G04 (2026-09-10): **a branch's `context_updates`
were the diff alone**. A key the branch target wrote back with the value the
fork snapshot already had was missing from `parallel.results`. The child
invocation's result now carries the result node's own `context_updates`
(`InvocationResult.updates`), and the branch step builds the envelope as
Fabro's `branch_context_updates` does: those updates first, then the public
diff, the diff winning a duplicate key. Petri's `failure_class` stage
bookkeeping is left out on both sides of that union; the pinned Fabro's
parallel handler runs a branch target outside the stage lifecycle that
writes the key, so its branch updates never carry it, and the earlier
record's claim that the empty-class filter was itself a difference was a
misreading of that bookkeeping. The `branch-context-updates-are-a-diff`
record is deleted; a recurrence is reported as an unresolved
`branch.context_updates.missing_in_petri` difference.

Retired by task 6: **parallel branch context**. Each branch now runs as a
child invocation from the fork snapshot, the fan-in publishes
`parallel.results` with every branch's `context_updates`, and nothing merges
into the parent context. Oracle case `static_fan_out_joins_all_branches`
records an empty context on both sides; its remaining difference is the path
(Petri lists the branch stages, Fabro records branch events), listed below.

Retired by task 7: **failure promotion order**. Petri now follows Fabro's
executor: a failure an explicit route matches stays failed and takes that
route; an unmatched failure under `on_failure="succeed"` is promoted and
reports `succeeded`. Oracle cases `succeed_keeps_a_failure_an_explicit_edge_matches`,
`succeed_keeps_a_failure_a_preferred_label_matches` and
`succeed_promotes_a_failure_no_explicit_edge_matches` match the pinned
Fabro with no departure. The `partially_succeed` spelling stays as an
accepted difference (below).

Retired with the Fabro re-pin to `05ebd0fd` (2026-09-13): **model fallback
session handoff**. The pinned Fabro now runs an agent stage's failover inside
Pebble, so it resumes the failed session's record on the next route as Petri
does: in `fallback-failover` the append runs once on both engines, the
fallback route's first request carries the history on both, and the request
sequences and counts match. The `fallback-session-handoff` record (which
accepted the request differences) and the `fallback-repeated-tool-effect`
record (the baseline defect) are deleted; a recurrence is reported as an
unresolved `request` or `artifact` difference.

Retired with the same re-pin (2026-09-14): **sub-agent nesting and
concurrency, inherited MCP tools, and compaction**. At `05ebd0fd` Fabro
hands Pebble `SubagentOptions::enabled()` with Pebble's defaults (no depth
limit, four open sessions per tree; `handler/llm/pebble.rs`), Pebble
registers every MCP tool `allow_in_subagents` so a child calls the
workflow's servers through the parent's connection, and compaction is
Pebble's own (`with_context_compaction(true)`, the same 80 percent trigger
and six preserved turns) with the summary call's usage folded into the
stage's account from `CompactionCompleted`. Petri does the same on the same
Pebble revision, so the `subagent-nesting-and-concurrency`,
`subagent-mcp-tools`, `compaction-always-on` and `compaction-summary-usage`
records are deleted; none of them accepted a difference kind, so the
comparison is unchanged. `subagent-usage-separate` stays: Fabro bills a
stage the tree's usage, Petri reports the children's beside the parent's.

Retired 2026-09-13: **model fallback configuration errors**. A
`[run.model.fallbacks]` table the catalog cannot resolve failed the first
LLM stage with class `bad_config`; it now fails the run at its `start`
stage, before anything runs, as Fabro's server refuses it at run start.
Since 2026-09-17 the shipped runner refuses it earlier still: with a model
client, `Runtime::check` resolves every model and chain at admission, so
the workflow is rejected when it is loaded (`attractor.model.fallbacks`,
`attractor.model.unknown`) and no run directory is written
(`fabro_fallback_blackbox::a_bad_fallback_table_is_refused_at_load`,
`an_unknown_provider_is_refused_at_load`); the `start` stage check remains
for a graph admitted without a client. The `fallback-resolution` record
keeps its two remaining differences.

Retired with review finding G05: **promotion after retries**. The last
retryable failure was converted by the engine's exhaustion policy before any
explicit route was considered, so an `outcome=failed` edge did not recover
from an exhausted gate under `on_failure="succeed"`. The Fabro steps now
finalize the exhausted retry themselves, in Fabro's order: `allow_partial`
accepts it with no route check; `succeed` checks the explicit routes first
and promotes only an unmatched failure, which then reports `succeeded`.
Acceptance `exhaustion.rs` states the expectations from the pinned source;
they have no captured fixture because the pinned binary was not available
when they were written, and `scripts/oracle-regenerate.sh` can add one.

## Accepted differences

These stay in the contract. They are tested as Petri differences, not as
reference expectations. Each row is one decision record under
`crates/fabro/acceptance/decisions/`, which is the index the differential
comparison loads; one record found by the matrix has no row here:
`fabro-run-title-call` (Fabro's run-title request on the provider's small
default model before the first stage).

| Difference | Petri | Fabro |
|---|---|---|
| Firing cap | 500 firings per looped node; an explicit limit above 500 is refused at load | unlimited when visit limits are unset or zero |
| Invocation maximum | a hard 10,000 workflow invocations per run; cannot be raised or disabled | no counterpart |
| Unknown attributes | a graph, node or edge attribute Fabro does not define is refused at load (`attractor.unknown_attribute`), with the closest Fabro attribute as the hint; the `x.` namespace and the Graphviz layout attributes are dropped silently | accepted silently: the validator has no rule for attribute names, and an unknown attribute does nothing |
| `outcome=success` | matched as `succeeded` with a warning until 2026-10-04, then refused | accepted, never matches |
| ACP tool hooks | best effort at the two boundaries ACP offers: `pre_tool_use` at `session/request_permission` (a block rejects the call; otherwise allow always without a hook, allow once with one), `post_tool_use` and `post_tool_use_failure` at a reported `tool_call_update`; an `attractor.hook.warning` per configured hook names what it can see, and one per tool call the agent ran without asking (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "Hooks") | ignored silently |
| `stage_retrying` hook | dispatched before each retry attempt; its decision is ignored | declared, never dispatched |
| Run-level hook reports | `run_complete`, `run_failed` and `sandbox_cleanup` reports are recorded at run level (`run.note.recorded` coordinator records), so `replay_run` carries them with no subject and `parsed.note.kind = hook` and `petri inspect` lists them under `notes`; retired difference `run-level-hook-reports` | platform events |
| Terminal echo | a stage's echoed output is bounded at 64 KiB (one marker names the log file, which keeps everything); a branch's lines carry its invocation (`[invocation-N/node#firing]`) | the platform's log viewer |
| `[run.agent]` keys | `subagents`, `compaction` and any key other than `fabro_tools`, `mcps` and `skills` are refused (`unsupported.workflow_toml.key`): the pinned Fabro's `[run.agent]` denies unknown keys and has no setting for sub-agents or compaction; sub-agents are always on for native agents, so the `subagents` refusal says so | refused by the parser |
| `[run.agent] skills` | a Petri extension: extra skill directories searched after Fabro's three, warned `fabro.petri_extension` | refused by the parser |
| Skill files that do not parse | reported: an `attractor.skills.warning` event and a stderr line per skipped `SKILL.md` and per unsearchable directory, from Pebble's `SkillsDiscovered.skipped` report, and per workflow-named directory that does not exist, from Petri's own probe; the file is still skipped, as Pebble skips it | Pebble's `SkillsDiscovered.skipped` report reaches the run's events verbatim (`agent.skills.discovered`); no warning, notice or stderr line of Fabro's own |
| A prompt naming a missing skill (`/name`) | the node fails with class `skill_missing` | the stage fails with Pebble's `invalid_input` error (`Unknown skill: /name`) |
| Sub-agent usage | the stage's `pebble.usage` is the parent session's own; the children's usage is the `pebble.subagents` metric and the backend envelopes forwarded in `step.progress.recorded` | the stage's usage is the tree's: the root plus every descendant from Pebble's `SessionProjection`, each priced at its own model |
| `checkpoint_saved` hook | warning; the hook does not run | dispatched with no built-in behavior |
| Sensitive answers (`sensitive=true`, `$secret`) | a Petri extension | not defined |
| Skipped stages in the path | Petri records a `skipped` final outcome (oracle case `skipped_outcome_routes_like_success`) | no stage record |
| Parallel branches in the path | each branch's stage has a final record in its child invocation, so the path lists the branches in branch order between the fork and the join (oracle case `static_fan_out_joins_all_branches`) | branches are `parallel` events, not stages; the path skips them |
| `for_each` over an empty list | the template fires once with the IR's placeholder item (`{"$placeholder": true}`); the fan-in strips it and joins zero results with no model call, and the public event stream shows a fork with zero branches (the clone has no branch role) | zero branches |
| `on_failure="partially_succeed"` | a Petri extension: Fabro's `succeed` promotion order, but the promoted stage reports `partially_succeeded` (oracle case `partially_succeed_policy_classifies_before_routing`, warned `fabro.petri_extension`) | refused by the validator (`on_failure_valid`) |
| `[environments.*] image.dockerfile` | accepted silently as a platform key; the scope runs on the selected backend's default runner image, or on `image.docker` when named | builds the image on the platform |
| Workflow secrets | `{{ secrets.NAME }}` resolves from `PETRI_SECRET_NAME` in the standalone runner; an embedding host supplies its own `SecretProvider` | the platform vault |
| Output references | `blob://sha256/<hex>` in a local store under `<run_dir>/blobs`, replaceable through the `OutputStore` capability; a structured value's reference carries `#json`. Below Fabro's 100 KiB threshold, a fork also offloads the `for_each` source list (any size) and other fork snapshot values above 4 KiB from every branch child's context, and a fan-in publishes `parallel.results` above 4 KiB as a reference; the agent and prompt preambles and a nested workflow's start context put those back, `stdin_source` and prompted fan-ins read them back, and a condition sees the reference text | `blob://sha256/<hex>` in platform storage, materialized as `file://…/blobs/<hex>.json` for handlers; nothing under 100 KiB is ever a reference |
| Prompt events | `StepEvent::Custom` with `kind = "attractor.prompt"` / `"attractor.prompt.completed"` (see `crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "Steps at run time") | `stage.prompt` / `prompt.completed` |
| MCP events | Pebble's own events forwarded in `step.progress.recorded`: `McpServerReady`, `McpServerFailed`, `McpServerDisconnected`, and `ToolCallStarted`/`ToolCallCompleted` under `mcp__<server>__<tool>` (`error_kind` `timeout`, `unavailable`, `cancelled`, `denied`, ...); one `StepEvent::Custom` kind, `attractor.mcp.unavailable`, for a server Petri never named to Pebble because its secret is unavailable; the failure line `mcp server \`<name>\` failed to start: ...` on the node's stderr for both. No Petri restatement of Pebble's server or tool facts (decision `pebble-events-are-the-agent-contract`) | the same Pebble events, stored verbatim under `agent.mcp.server.ready` / `agent.mcp.server.failed` / `agent.mcp.server.disconnected` and `agent.tool.started` / `agent.tool.completed`; the former `agent.mcp.ready` / `failed` / `disconnected` mirrors are gone |
| MCP catalog references | `[run.agent.mcps.<name>] id = "..."` resolves against the catalog an embedding host binds (`fabro.mcp_catalog_toml`); the standalone runner binds none and refuses the reference at load | resolved from the server's catalog |
| MCP secrets | `{{ secrets.NAME }}` resolves as a whole `env` or `headers` value only, from `PETRI_SECRET_NAME` (or the host's provider) at launch; a token inside a command, script or URL is refused at load | resolved anywhere in the transport strings at the run boundary from the vault |
| MCP `sandbox` transport | launched through the scope's execution environment and reached through the provider's preview URL (the host's loopback, the Docker plugin's port forward into the container, Daytona's preview link with its token header); a provider without preview URLs fails the server with a named reason | the same: the provider's route through Pebble's `PortRoutes` (`SandboxPortRoutes` over the driver's preview facet: the host's loopback, the Docker plugin's port forward, Daytona's preview link) |
| MCP stdio working directory | the scope's workspace when the scope shares the host filesystem, else Petri's own directory | the run worker's directory |
| Model fallback: provider-only candidates | a bare provider in a chain resolves to the same model id on that provider when its catalog lists it, else `NoCompatibleModel` | picks the provider's closest model by feature profile and price |
| Model fallback: unknown selectors | a selector no catalog row names is skipped with a notice unless the provider allows passthrough models | passed through for the provider to validate |
| Model fallback: ACP agents | no plan; the ACP command owns its model | the same |
| Model fallback: events | `StepEvent::Custom` kind `attractor.fallback.plan` and the once-per-run stderr notices; every route fact is Pebble's own event forwarded in `step.progress.recorded` (`SessionStarted`, `RouteFailover`, `RouteFailoverStopped`, `AssistantMessage`), with the `model fallback: ...` line on the node's stderr; no `route`, `usage`, `failover` or `stop` kinds and no `metrics.custom.fallback.*` (decision `pebble-events-are-the-agent-contract`) | Pebble's `agent.route.failover` and `agent.route.failover.stopped` stored verbatim for agent stages, `prompt.failover` for prompt stages, and run notices; the former `agent.failover` mirror is gone |
| Model fallback: recovery | a resumed node starts a new plan at position 0 on the primary; a request in flight at the crash may be sent again | an exported-conversation cache in the run worker's process, cleared at shutdown: a run resumed in a fresh process starts a new session and a plan at position 0, the same |
| MCP server lifetime | one set of servers per agent node session, started by Pebble while the agent is built and closed with it (a retained thread's next node starts its own); a resumed run starts them again | one set per agent session; the same |

## Advanced agent milestones (item 9, milestones C1 to C5)

The overall item 9 gate: all five advanced-agent stages pass their own
acceptance gates. Status at task 16's finishing time (2026-09-07). Task 16
owns C5 and this checklist; the other four stages ran in parallel, so a stage
whose branch had not merged onto `swarm/integration` when task 16 finished is
marked "not verified" with the reason, not "passed".

| Stage | Acceptance gate | Branch / commit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 model fallback and failover (item 9a, task 12) | scripted provider failures exercise selection order, session handling, terminal outcome, and complete usage/events | `swarm/task12-fallback`, commits `240e0c9`..`f0ce08e` and after (evidence `task12-fallback.md`) | passed on the branch with integration merged (tasks 13 to 16 in): selection order and the reference's notices (`fallback::tests`, 10 unit tests); through the binary with both twins injecting failures (`fabro_fallback_blackbox`, 15 cases: primary, qualifying and non-qualifying, a third provider, exhaustion, a tool effect kept across the handoff, cancellation, refusal, timeout, client retries, a workflow retry, effort mapping, repair turns, a retained thread, a prompt node); the outcome and per-route accounting rebuilt from public events (`fallback_events`, 3); the client's own retries and budget (`llm_client`, 2). Reference sequences derived from the pinned source, not captured from the binary |
| C2 MCP execution (item 9b, task 13) | a configured local MCP server's tool effect, hooks, output, events, cancellation and shutdown are verified | `swarm/task13-mcp`, commits `b67d3ee`..`72be261` (evidence `task13-mcp.md`) | passed: merged; the MCP suites and the scripted stdio server (`fabro_mcp_blackbox`, `testdata`) pass in the gate (1192) |
| C3 skills (item 9c, task 14) | versioned fixtures verify skill discovery, precedence, loading, prompt/tool behavior and events without Fabro | `swarm/task14-skills`, commits `c27fc3e`, `bdd5c5a` (evidence `task14-skills.md`) | passed: merged; the skills suites and fixtures (`testdata/skills`) pass in the gate; skill context is loaded into the system prompt, outside the agent history, so compaction cannot remove it (verified below) |
| C4 sub-agents (item 9d, task 15) | a parent delegates real work; results, ownership, cancellation, hooks and child identities match the reference | `swarm/task15-subagents`, commits `8861076`..`303f682`, `e8d20e1`, `269daca`, `ad2d472`, the merges `bd14208`, `3cbc1bc` and the task 16 merge (evidence `task15-subagents.md`) | passed: every native agent has Pebble's sub-agent tools (the pinned Fabro has no setting either; `[run.agent] subagents` stays refused because Fabro's parser refuses it); a parent delegates a workspace change to a child, hooks block inside a child, a child's failure is the parent's tool result, concurrent children and a grandchild, an interrupt closes the child, a retained thread keeps a child's result, resume restarts the stage, children never count against the invocation ceiling, accounting reconstructs from the public events. In-process `petri-attractor-steps::subagents` (14, the child memory and skills contract tests included since the Pebble re-pin), black box `fabro_subagents_blackbox` (8, one with an inherited MCP tool). Accepted difference above: usage beside the parent's (nesting under the open-session bound and inherited MCP tools are the reference's behaviour too since `05ebd0f`) |
| C5 context compaction (item 9e, task 16) | controlled histories trigger compaction and preserve required conversation/tool state, later thread use, usage, and events | `swarm/task16-compaction`, this branch | passed: the trigger below, at and above the 80 percent threshold; continuation, thread reuse, tool pairing across the boundary, summary failure, cancellation, resume fallback; public events and usage. In-process `petri-attractor-steps::compaction` (7), black box `fabro_compaction_blackbox` (4) |

Skill context across compaction (item 9e's cross-feature check, C3 landed):
skills reach a native session through Pebble's `with_skill_dirs`, which folds
the discovered skills into the session's system prompt and registers the
`use_skill`/`Skill` tool. The system prompt and the tool registry live on the
session outside `History`; compaction only ever replaces turns inside
`History` (`pebble-coding-agent` `compact_from`). So a compacted session keeps
its skills and its skill tool.

Sub-agents (C4) landed: the supervisor lives on the session outside
`History`, so a parent that compacts keeps it; verified end to end by
`petri-attractor-steps::subagents::a_parent_still_delegates_after_its_own_compaction`
(the turn after the parent's compaction spawns a child and waits for it, and
the later request carries the summary, not the discarded output). A child
inherits the parent's compaction settings and policy through Pebble's
`ChildDeps`: `a_child_compacts_under_the_inherited_settings_and_its_events_name_the_child`
shows a child crossing the trigger, its own summary call, Pebble's
`CompactionStarted`/`CompactionCompleted` on the shared stream under the
child's session naming the parent, and the stage's `pebble.subagents.sessions`
entry counting the compaction. A child's compaction produces no
`attractor.compaction` event and no `pebble.compaction_usage`: the sink folds
those from the parent session's own events. Pebble bills the child's summary
call to the child's own prompt, so the ledger's `pebble.subagents.sessions`
usage carries it.

MCP (C2) landed: the servers are Pebble's tool sources
(`CodingAgentBuilder::mcp_servers`, `pebble.rs`), so their tools live in the
session's tool registry, outside `History`; compaction replaces only `History`, so a compacted
session keeps its MCP tools. Verified end to end by the readiness suites
(milestone D below): the `review` node calls the MCP tool on the compacted
thread, and the call is on the public stream (`fabro.mcp.tool` on `review`).


## Milestone D: the final readiness audit (item 10, task 20)

Status at task 20's finishing time (2026-09-07), audited against the code
and tests on `swarm/task20-readiness` with `swarm/integration` `dbddbfb`
merged, not against evidence prose. **Final readiness is met** with the
recorded gaps below, each with an owner; no required row keeps a deferred
status without one. The integration handoff is
[`crates/fabro/HANDOFF.md`](../HANDOFF.md); the event contract and its
coverage matrix are `crates/core/execution/EVENTS.md`. The evidence file is
`.ai/reviews/fabro-unified/task20-readiness.md`.

### Milestones

| Milestone | Passed | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| A (items 1, 2 initial) | yes | `fabro_blackbox::milestone_a_smoke_run_without_fabro_on_path`, `standalone.rs`, `fabro_dependencies.rs`; evidence `task5-milestone-a.md` |
| B (items 2 to 8) | yes | `fabro_milestone_blackbox` (3 cases, rerun at task 20: 4 of 4), `embedding::the_milestone_workflow_runs_through_the_embedding_boundary`, `fabro_terminal_blackbox` (10); evidence `task11-milestone-b.md` |
| C1 to C5 (item 9) | yes, the table above | `fabro_fallback_blackbox` (15), `fabro_mcp_blackbox` (9), `fabro_skills_blackbox` (4), `fabro_subagents_blackbox` (8), `fabro_compaction_blackbox` (4), their in-process suites |
| D (item 10) | yes, with the gaps below | the combined suites next |

### Combined, recovery and embedding tests

- Combined execution through the binary: `fabro_readiness_blackbox` (cells
  `readiness/combined@host/openai`, `readiness/combined-failure@host/openai`,
  `readiness/combined-cancellation@host/openai`): one run with a skill-guided
  plan, a hooked MCP write, a hooked sub-agent, a scripted decision, a
  `for_each` fan-out, a compaction and a later node reusing the compacted
  thread (with an MCP call on it), and a second thread failing over to the
  Anthropic twin and continuing there; failure (an exhausted chain) and
  cancellation (an interrupt inside a child's tool) apart. Each case checks
  output attribution, answer routing, the final status through `petri
  inspect`, the retained workspace, the absence of Git commits, tags and
  pushes in the repository the run prepared, and every item 9 family on the
  public stream.
- The same execution through the embedding example:
  `embedding_readiness::the_combined_workflow_runs_through_the_embedding_boundary`
  (a host with its own hooks, interviewer and sink; the same scripts spent in
  the same order, the same files, the run rebuilt from public events, replay
  equal to the live stream).
- Local replay and sandbox recovery, preserved and passing:
  `inspect_cli::inspect_reconstructs_a_restarted_run_with_children_after_the_process_exits`,
  `inspect_cli::inspect_reports_torn_logs_as_incomplete_and_corrupt_logs_as_errors`,
  `petri-execution::inspect::a_torn_coordinator_tail_is_dropped_and_left_in_place`,
  `embedding::recovery_redelivers_with_stable_identities`,
  `petri::host::a_crashed_run_resumes_from_the_run_dir`,
  `petri-driver::resume` (`a_torn_tail_is_truncated_and_resumed`,
  `a_tampered_record_refuses_to_resume`, `an_undecodable_record_refuses_resume`,
  `resume_reacquires_held_scopes`, `resume_fences_the_crashed_container`,
  `interrupted_stop_resumes_the_same_sandbox_and_workspace`),
  `petri-execution::sandbox_recovery`
  (`allocation_crashes_recover_without_replacing_the_workspace`,
  `recovery_refuses_a_changed_fingerprint_or_a_lost_workspace`),
  `petri-attractor-steps::parallel::resume_keeps_a_finished_branch_and_finishes_the_unfinished_one`,
  `petri::controls::the_breaker_state_is_restored_on_resume`,
  `petri-attractor-steps::subagents::a_resumed_run_restarts_the_stage_and_keeps_an_unfinished_childs_files`.
  Fabro's, by the plan: Git-backed workspace restoration, database
  transaction recovery, platform event migration, publication deduplication,
  old-runner retention (`HANDOFF.md`, "What stays Fabro's").
- Production code has no Fabro, database or UI dependency:
  `fabro_dependencies.rs` (the full resolve graph, every kind, nested
  manifests and build scripts), `standalone.rs` (no `fabro` on `PATH`);
  `cargo tree -p petri-cli -e normal` names no database or UI crate (the
  twins and `axum` are dev-dependencies of the test crates only).

Since 2026-09-07 a fork has at most `max_parallel` live children (`petri-execution::admission::a_fork_of_fifty_children_keeps_four_live_and_starts_them_in_order`, `cancelling_the_parent_finishes_every_queued_child_as_cancelled`, `resume_redispatches_queued_children_under_the_bound`), the coordinator store applies each record in place (`petri-execution::store::tests::a_rejected_event_leaves_the_state_and_the_log_untouched`, `a_failed_write_leaves_the_state_unchanged_and_is_reported`), and since 2026-09-08 the `attractor/fork` step offloads the fork snapshot so every branch child is declared from references (`petri-attractor-steps::parallel::a_fifty_item_fork_declares_its_children_from_references`, `a_resumed_run_reads_the_offloaded_results_after_the_fork`, `two_forks_in_sequence_keep_every_child_small`, `fabro_blackbox::a_fifty_item_fork_declares_small_children_and_prompts_still_see_the_list`, lowering `a_static_fork_keeps_a_nested_for_each_list_inline_in_its_snapshot`). Measured with one probe (`.ai/reviews/fabro-unified/fanout-offload-snapshot.md`): one 1,000-item fork went from 43 s, 8.1 GB peak RSS and a 266 MB `coordinator.jsonl` to 28.5 s, 161 MB and 2.7 MB; bytes per child are flat at about 2.7 KB from 100 to 1,000 items; the two-fork run went from 133 s, 39 GB and 1.66 GB to 58 s, 343 MB and 5.7 MB (release). What remains is the `fsync` per coordinator record (five per child, about 25 ms of the 28 ms per child) and the one O(N) `NodeExpanded` record per fork.

### Known limitations carried into the handoff

1. Fan-out scale: the bytes per branch child are bounded by the fan-out
   offload threshold and no longer grow with the item count (above); time
   is linear in N and dominated by the five `fsync` calls per child (one
   per coordinator record plus the engine-log header), about 25 ms of the
   28 ms per child; the one `NodeExpanded` record per fork is O(N) once.
   Live children are bounded to `max_parallel`. Owner Petri core.
2. Retained agent threads restart from the `summary:high` preamble on
   resume, as in Fabro (its `AgentApiBackend` keeps full-fidelity sessions
   in an in-memory map per worker); this is parity, not a gap. Pause is
   durable across resume (`petri resume --run-dir`).
3. The implement family runs inline graphs of the bundle's shape (an accepted
   migration, task 17): the pinned child's verify node hard-codes the Fabro
   repository's own toolchain, which no cell installs. Its Docker cell runs
   the same inline graph in a container since 2026-09-10
   (`implement_child_runs_successfully_docker`); the manager loop, the
   child's deterministic check and the parent's context all run inside the
   scope.
4. Every scenario runs on both backends since 2026-09-13: each of the 45
   scenario files has a host cell and a Docker cell (the Docker set was
   seven cells before). The container cells run under a bounded Nextest
   group (`fabro-docker`, `.config/nextest.toml`) so the full gate cannot
   starve them past their deadlines. The ACP agent backend is claimed
   through scripted ACP agents only (the `acp` scenario family, "ACP agent
   backend" in the readiness table below, and Petri's scripted agent in
   `petri-attractor-steps::acp`); the real ACP products have their own live
   tier (`petri::acp_products`, `--ignored`) and, with Daytona, are gated
   separately and not claimed.
5. `fix-ci` is excluded by the owner's decision of 2026-09-07.
6. Hosted CI's first run (2026-09-08) failed at its dependency setup: the
   private-dependency deploy keys did not exist. The owner made Pebble,
   lithos-llm, and sandbox-driver public and had the bundle files vendored,
   so CI needs no key. The push run on `67f4cb0` (2026-09-09, run
   34325364222) then passed all three jobs, as did the push runs on
   `97fb247` (34379457228) and `2463979` (34394908040). The first scheduled
   nightly, on `67f4cb0` (34351051790), failed on two defects fixed in
   `ffdddda` and `fd806fc`; the nightly on `2463979` passed (34405186288 on
   2026-09-09, 34476177672 on 2026-09-10). Those runs showed one blocked
   cell, which the matrix declared at the time. No commit after `2463979`
   has a hosted run yet; a passing earlier commit does not certify a later
   one.
7. Retired: a `for_each` fan-out emits `fork.started`, `branch.completed`
   and `fork.completed` with the identities a static fork has (the parallel
   node is the fork, the clones are members by item index, the fan-in is the
   join), derived from the engine's applied splices by the same branch map
   the static path uses (`EVENTS.md`).
8. Retired: Pebble exports its project-memory loader (`ProjectMemory`), and a
   prompt node loads its documents through it over the scope, so one loader
   owns the budget, deduplication and truncation for native sessions and
   prompt nodes alike; `attractor_steps::memory` keeps only Fabro's path
   selection.
9. Retired: the interview bundle's model comes from the launch,
   `petri run --provider` and `--model`.

## Library pin

Pebble is locked at `ba2928d` (Pebble PR #31) and lithos-llm at `f40391a`,
where `Observer::on_retry` takes one `RetryEvent`; Petri reaches it only
through Pebble's `RetryEventObserver`. Before that, Pebble was locked at
`3f969ec83531990679733f5f7b82fe99d7100444`, the merge
of Pebble PR #28, which names lithos-llm and sandbox-driver by
`branch = "main"` as Petri does. It sits on `13a7798`, the merge of Pebble
PR #27 (the `sandbox_driver` module that replaces Fabro's
`fabro-pebble-sandbox` crate, behind Pebble's `sandbox-driver` feature) on
top of Pebble `main` at `b2512a2`. Petri does not use that module; the pin moves because
Fabro's `fabro-petri` hands Pebble types to Petri's crates and
sandbox-driver handles to that module, so the two repositories must pin
one Pebble revision and one sandbox-driver revision. Between `67c9f48` (PRs #23 and #24 on top of `a39f43e`:
the lithos-llm pin and the `codecs` catalogs) and this pin, Pebble folded
the session projection's lifetime tallies into
`SessionProjection::totals`; the subagent metrics read them from there,
and the serialized shape is unchanged. lithos-llm stayed at
`43a42ac28e9d9bcf40a91abc02be4f12ca274ebb`, lithoscomputer/lithos-llm #8,
#9, #10, and #13 on top of #7: the four adapter features are gone (each meant
`runtime`); a catalog provider names one `adapter` (default `http`) and a
`codecs` list (default `["openai-chat"]`), and the loader rejects the old
`codec` key and the four protocol-named adapter ids; the built-in catalog
gains the `vercel` and `typesafe` providers, and the client gains
`evaluate`. Petri's three test catalogs (`fallback.rs`,
`model_admission.rs`, `check_source.rs`) move to `codecs = [...]`; nothing
else in Petri named the old fields or features.
`a39f43e26effdf99635eaf343f095c17157c9c93` is Pebble PR #22 on top of
`c91810f`. PR #22
finishes the one-usage-type plan in the stored shapes: `Message::Assistant`'s
`usage` and `StoredMessage::Assistant`'s `usage` are lithos-llm's `Usage`
(they were `TokenCounts`), so a turn's cost travels with its counts, and
the session record is format 5 (`SESSION_RECORD_FORMAT_VERSION`). A record
of any other version is refused before its route is read:
`SessionRecord::is_supported` is false and `CodingRuntime::from_record`
fails with `CodingAgentBuildError::UnsupportedRecord { version, supported }`
("session record format version 4 is not supported (this build requires
5)"); nothing migrates it. Petri stores no session record: a retained
thread is Pebble's warm `CodingAgentExport`, held in memory for the run and
never written (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "Fidelity and threads"), so no
record of Petri's can be format 4; and Petri constructs no
`Message::Assistant`, so the pin moves with no Petri code change.
`c91810fe51aece80359b9cd8efea971af0c46925` is Pebble PRs #18, #19 and #20
on top of `6996942`. PR #18 adds tool-result and transcript rendering options to
`pebble-cli-core`, which Petri does not use. PR #19 keeps a paired human's
hold across a route failover; Petri needs no change for it. PR #20 is step
2 of the one-usage-type plan: it deletes Pebble's `TokenUsage` and its
`CostSource` copy, re-exports lithos-llm's `TokenCounts`, `Cost`,
`CostSource` and `Usage` from `pebble_coding_agent::types` and `events`,
and collapses every `usage` beside a `cost_usd_micros` into one
`usage: Usage` (`{ tokens: { input, output, reasoning, cache_read,
cache_write }, cost: { usd_micros, source } }`, `cost` absent when unknown)
on `AssistantMessage` (whose `cost_source` is gone too),
`CompactionCompleted`, `CompactionFailed` (`Option<Usage>`),
`RouteFailover`, `PromptReport`, `SessionProjection`, `PromptDelta`,
`DescendantAccount`, `CompactionProjection` and `RouteFailoverProjection`;
both `descendant_usage()` return a `Usage`. Every sum is
`Usage::saturating_add`, so a total has a cost only when every part that
used tokens was priced. Pebble's session record stayed format 4 there, an
assistant turn's counts stored bare (format 5, and the refusal of 4, come
with `a39f43e` above), and a stored event in the old shape reads back with
zero usage. Petri follows: its own `usage` payloads
and metrics take the same `Usage` (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "Usage"), and
`pebble.cost_usd_micros`, `pebble.compaction_cost_usd_micros`,
`prompt.cost_usd_micros` and every `cost_usd_micros` field are gone
(`crates/core/execution/EVENTS.md`, "Usage and timing"). lithos-llm moves
with it to `55add4596b861a0623d00c3a54aa5c147c8d504b`, which is
lithoscomputer/lithos-llm#7 on top of #6: `Usage` with `saturating_add`
and `total_tokens()`, `TokenCounts::saturating_add`,
`From<TokenCounts> for Usage` and `Response::usage_with_cost()`, all
additive; `TokenCounts`, `Cost`, `CostSource` and `Response` keep their
fields and serialized shapes.
`69969420c9017ca15ac6c175c820a0cb8090866a` is Pebble PRs #13, #14, #15 and
#16 on top of `430740f`. PR #13 folds the command line's closing summary onto
`SessionProjection` and adds `SessionProjection.retries` and
`PromptDelta.retries`, one per `LlmRetry` across the tree. PR #14 fixes the
two tests that flaked in Pebble's own CI (the MCP fixture's bind and the
sub-agent tool order) with no loosened assertion. PR #15 makes the route to
an environment-hosted MCP server's port Pebble's own contract,
`pebble_coding_agent::mcp::PortRoutes` (`route(port) -> PortRoute { url,
headers }`, `release(port)`, `PortRouteError::Unsupported` or `Failed`),
which `CodingAgentBuilder::port_routes` now takes, and drops sandbox-driver
from the `mcp` feature; Petri implements it as
`attractor_steps::pebble::environment::ScopePortRoutes` over
`ExecEnv::preview_url`, and its sandbox-driver pin no longer has to match
Pebble's. PR #16 completes `SessionProjection` for embedders: the summary
call's `usage` and `cost_usd_micros` (one `usage` since `c91810f`) on
`CompactionCompleted` and (when the model answered) `CompactionFailed`, the
failover history as
`SessionProjection.failovers` and `failover_stopped` with `PromptDelta.failovers`,
each descendant's `provider` and `model` on `DescendantAccount`,
`McpServerProjection.startup_ms`, and `SkillsDiscovered` announced again on a
warm start. Petri takes the pin and the `PortRoutes` contract here and reads
nothing new from the projection yet.
`430740f1114f859d6d173683f25b5007cf2023ca` is Pebble PR #12
(`embedder-failover-and-followup`)
on top of `4c00633`. PR #12 grows `CodingEvent::RouteFailover` with the
failed route's `usage`, `cost_usd_micros` (one `usage` since `c91810f`),
`inference_ms`, `tool_ms` and a
`continuation` (`replay_prompt` or `continue_turn`), adds
`CodingEvent::RouteFailoverStopped { route, attempt, reason, error }` with
`reason` `ineligible` or `exhausted` for a prompt Pebble did not fail over
although routes were named, and gives the steering bus a follow-up delivery
mode (`SteerableSession::follow_up`, `SteeringBus::follow_up` and
`follow_up_to`; a message buffered before a session attaches keeps its
mode). Petri runs its model failover in Pebble on those events and delivers
human text through the bus (`crates/attractor/steps/src/{fallback,pebble}.rs`).
`4c0063327394cd0f1e9fee2c24541b829b93a8f7` is the
`embedder-concerns` batch (Pebble PR #9)
plus Pebble PR #10 and PR #11. PR #11 adds `CodingEvent::McpServerDisconnected`
(a server's closed connection, reported once by the call that first found
it), `startup_ms` on `McpServerReady` and `McpServerFailed` (launch to tools
listed, or to the failure), `ToolErrorKind::Timeout` for a call with no
answer within `tool_timeout`, the shutdown of started MCP servers when
`build()` fails after they started, and a readiness probe for an `http`
server until its `startup_timeout` before the handshake; Petri mirrors the
first three as the `disconnected` phase, `duration_ms` on `ready` and
`failed`, and `status = "timeout"` (`crates/attractor/FORMAT.md`, "MCP
servers"). PR #10 moved the sandbox-driver pin under Pebble's `mcp` feature
to `a92c0db6b6a122ca9b6df75de6615544f53c0d47`, and Petri pinned the same
revision so the `PreviewUrls` trait object crossed the crate boundary; PR
#15 (above) ends that coupling. The `embedder-concerns` batch sits on top of
`petri-readiness-gaps` `6b7d26e0f791edf3381b110b78db1c5507c94f66`, which sat
on the readiness batch's `408638fe982ace5b570e04ba808be3a32d4001f7`. The
`embedder-concerns` batch moves concerns both embedders wrote into Pebble:
memory and skill discovery (`MemoryDiscovery`, `SkillDiscovery`, with the
profile's filenames Pebble's own), the environment helpers
(`environment::support`), compaction accounting on the prompt report
(`PromptReport::compactions`), the `SessionProjection` fold Petri's sub-agent
ledger now reads, fallback routes as a builder option, MCP servers as a tool
source, a steering bus, and the command line as a library. Petri takes the
first four here, MCP servers as a tool source (`attractor_steps::pebble::mcp`),
fallback routes (`attractor_steps::fallback` plans, Pebble runs and reports;
Pebble's `RouteFailover` and `RouteFailoverStopped` are the record) and the
steering bus (one per node run; deliveries are follow-ups, buffered until
the session attaches); the command line library is pinned but not adopted.
Pebble's event stream is the contract for every fact Pebble knows (decision
`pebble-events-are-the-agent-contract`).
`petri-readiness-gaps` added the two capabilities the
readiness review's G07 and G14 asked for and changed no existing behavior:
`CodingAgentOptions::with_max_tool_rounds` (a prompt ends with
`Error::ToolRoundsExhausted` and a `ToolRoundsExhausted` event when the
bound is reached) and the public `ProjectMemory` loader. The readiness
batch itself brought five changes:

- The summary call's usage and cost are in the prompt report, so
  `pebble.usage` (and, until `c91810f`, `pebble.cost_usd_micros`) includes
  compaction and the `pebble.compaction_*` metrics break that share out.
- `Agent::continue_prompt` and `CodingAgent::continue_prompt` continue an
  unfinished turn on the next model with no new input, so the failover no
  longer sends a continuation message.
- `SubagentOptions::with_inherited_memory()` and `with_inherited_skills()`
  give a child the parent's project documents and skill directories (the
  reference Fabro's own child runs with Pebble's defaults and inherits
  neither).
- `SkillsDiscovered.skipped` reports each skipped skill file with a reason,
  so Petri's diagnostics read Pebble's own report instead of auditing the
  files itself.
- The sub-agent tools of one round run in the model's order
  (`ToolScheduling::Sequential`), so a `wait` beside its own `spawn_agent`
  sees the child.

`RetryEventObserver` needed no Pebble change: it was already exported as
`pebble_coding_agent::events::RetryEventObserver`. Petri installs it on the
client (`petri::build_llm_client`), so the client's own retries reach the
agent's event stream as `LlmRetry`.

## Pinned revisions

Every library Petri runs Fabro workflows through is locked to one commit
(see "Git dependencies" in `DEVELOPING.md`). Each revision has one home, and
this table names it instead of copying it. The row names are the keys of an
evidence record's `pins` block, which the record reads from these sources
when it is written.

| Pin | Revision | Repository | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pebble` | `Cargo.lock` | `lithoscomputer/pebble` (public) | the agent loop and coding agent (`pebble-coding-agent`, `pebble-agent`) |
| `lithos_llm` | `Cargo.lock` | `lithoscomputer/lithos-llm` (public) | provider transport, request retries, and the `Usage` type every usage takes |
| `sandbox_driver` | `Cargo.lock` | `lithoscomputer/sandbox-driver` (public) | the sandbox plugin protocol and the host, Docker, and Daytona plugins |
| `twins` | `Cargo.lock` | `lithoscomputer/twins` (public) | the OpenAI and Anthropic provider twins the harness serves on loopback |
| `fabro_reference` | `crates/fabro/corpus-pin.txt` | `fabro-sh/fabro` (public, `main`) | the reference Fabro the corpus, oracle, bundles, and differential matrix use |
| `runner_image` | `RUNNER_PIN` in `crates/core/executor-sandbox/src/backend.rs` | `lithoscomputer/sandbox-images` (public) | the default runner images (`ghcr.io/lithoscomputer/ubuntu-*`) Docker and Daytona scopes start from (PyYAML present since `df708f910111`) |

A change to Pebble or lithos-llm runs the owning
repository's required checks before Petri moves its lock; then the affected
scenarios run again, and their evidence records cite the new commits. The library batch
the readiness work asked for is inside the pinned revisions (Pebble `4c00633`,
sandbox-driver `a92c0db6`); the twins track `main` in both test crates that
serve them. Since Pebble `6996942` Pebble's `mcp` feature no longer names
the sandbox-driver crate; since Pebble PR #27 its `sandbox-driver` feature
names it again, and Fabro builds that feature beside Petri's crates, so
Petri and Pebble both name sandbox-driver by `branch = "main"` and the
lockfile holds one copy. sandbox-driver is locked at `7d1932b5` (the merge of PR #65),
which shares Daytona allocation normalization with Petri. Runner minimums,
snapshot identity and status comparisons now use the driver's effective
allocation. The preceding pin `236196ed` adds
Daytona's cursor-based sandbox listing (lithoscomputer/sandbox-driver#62) and
tracks daytona-sdk-rust `main` (#64) on top of `583a1646`. `583a1646`
(the merge of lithoscomputer/sandbox-driver#61, `7cc5d5ba`, into `main` on
`6eb41d0`) lets a second process attach read-only to a managed host
workspace with its registry record: `HostProvider::observe_registry` reads
the registry another process owns without writing it, `attach_directory`
resolves a workspace path to that record (id, labels, ownership, state),
and the handle refuses `start`, `stop`, and `delete` with the new
`Error::ReadOnly` (wire kind `read_only`), so Fabro's `petri.run`
ownership check runs on the host as it does on Docker. Petri's own use of
the driver is unchanged by it. sandbox-driver `07600aa5` (lithoscomputer/sandbox-driver#23,
on `64c14b89`) lets an idle Host sentinel kill its own process group once
its owning provider pid is gone, so a provider that is killed rather than
stopped leaves no sentinel behind; a running workload still survives its
owner so recovery can fence it. Before it, every Petri test run left its
idle sentinels orphaned. sandbox-driver `64c14b89` (lithoscomputer/sandbox-driver#22,
on `ddb32e19`) stops the Daytona plugin failing an exec on a torn output
frame: its decoder discards the unreadable record through the next newline,
resyncs, and counts what it threw away in
`ExecStreamingResult::output_loss` (`OutputLoss { dropped_frames,
dropped_bytes }`, `is_lossy()`), carried across the plugin wire as an
additive field, with `truncated` set on both captures because the lost
record's stream is unknown. Petri's sandbox environment
(`crates/core/executor-sandbox/src/env.rs`) reads the report: a lossy
result keeps the command's exit status instead of failing as an incomplete
delivery, one `warn!` names both counters, and one line, `[sandbox] N
output frame(s), M bytes dropped by the provider`, is appended to the
command's stderr after its own output, so the agent that ran the command
and the run log both see the loss; a lossless result is unchanged.
`ddb32e19` (lithoscomputer/sandbox-driver#21) gives the protocol crate's
`PluginSupervisor` numbered generations, a health probe before a generation
serves, and a refusal of a replacement that reports another resource
namespace; Petri's own supervisor is gone, and `executor-sandbox`'s
`PluginSource` configures the protocol crate's with `PluginSettings`.

## Readiness gate checklist

The black box plan's "Verification and readiness gate", item by item, with
where the evidence for each comes from. Status as of task 20 (2026-09-07),
on `swarm/integration` `dbddbfb` merged into the task 20 branch. "met" has a
passing check on that tree; "partial" names what is missing and who closes
it.

| Item | Evidence source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Repeatable focused task on the same required set as CI | `mise run test:fabro:blackbox` runs `scripts/test-fabro-blackbox.sh`: every `petri-cli` `fabro_*blackbox` binary (the readiness suite included) plus `standalone`, `fabro_cli` and the oracle test, same build and features as `mise run test`, evidence and coverage report per run | met |
| Extended variations and repeated process-isolation runs in `check:nightly` | `mise run check:nightly` on every nightly runner: `test:fabro:blackbox:repeat` (three runs under different schedules), `test:long`, `test:fabro:differential`, `check:msrv`, `test:release`; the nightly workflow then runs `check:fabro:readiness` (the strict set, `test:fabro:blackbox:strict`, plus the readiness verdict) on the runners that have Docker, since the strict task requires a daemon | met |
| Library changes run the owning repository's checks before Petri pins them | `README.md` "Library and repository gates", `DEVELOPING.md`; the "Pinned revisions" table above | met; the batch is locked |
| Protocol retry, Pebble replay, Petri retry, and cross-layer cases distinct; a provider interruption after a non-idempotent tool effect | `llm_client.rs`, `fabro_fallback_blackbox::a_tool_effect_is_not_repeated_across_a_failover`, `client_retries_are_spent_before_the_chain_advances`, `a_workflow_retry_is_not_a_failover`, `fallback_events.rs` | met |
| Required CI verifies the vendored bundles and the pinned twins, requires the corpus, fails on an absent asset, binary, scenario, or backend | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `PETRI_REQUIRE_*`; `tests/support/fabro/require.rs`; `mise run check:bundles` | met: the push runs on `67f4cb0` (34325364222), `97fb247` (34379457228) and `2463979` (34394908040) passed every job with no fetch and no key (2026-09-09) |
| Every required host scenario in routine CI; the Docker subset on Linux | `mise run check` runs the whole suite on both runners; Docker cases skip on macOS and are required on Linux; every planned cell of `matrix.json` has a test | met; hosted on the runs above (Linux with Docker required, macOS host cells) |
| The pinned Fabro comparison matrix as a required compatibility job; nightly adds repetitions | `fabro compatibility (ubuntu-24.04)`: cached pinned build, `test:fabro:differential` (five live cells, zero unresolved differences) | met; the compatibility job passed on the runs above and in the nightly on `2463979` (34405186288, 34476177672) |
| A machine-readable record per scenario | `tests/support/fabro/record.rs`, one record per scenario cell, `compatibility.differential` from the engine records | met |
| Full failure bundles and compact success results retained in CI | the two `actions/upload-artifact` steps per job; the job summary carries `coverage.md` | met; artifacts and summaries on the runs above |
| Coverage report with required, passed, failed, blocked, excluded; skips and exclusions never count | `scripts/fabro-coverage-report.py`, `--strict` in routine CI (a blocked cell is shown, not failed) and `--readiness` in `mise run check:fabro:readiness` (the final gate: every required cell passed, blocked cells included); with bundles fetched and every gate required: required 99 since 2026-09-13 (54 host cells: the three readiness cells, the five differential cells and the routing oracle included; 45 Docker cells, one per scenario file), blocked 0 (the `implement/child-runs-successfully@docker/openrouter` cell has run in a container since 2026-09-10), excluded 6 (`fix-ci`). A pinned-Fabro assertion a decision record lists under `known_defects` counts as passed with a note naming the record; any other failed assertion fails the cell | met |
| Every bundle materializes with verified dependencies and concrete inputs | `bundles.lock.json`, the fetcher (5 of 5 verified locally); concrete inputs per scenario | met; `implement-issue` runs as inline graphs of the bundle's shape on both backends (the pinned bundle's own verify node needs the Fabro toolchain) |
| Every required scenario and backend cell passes with no skips, unmatched calls, unexpected interviews, or unused replies | the strict coverage report plus each record's `services[].unmatched_requests` and interview receipt | met; no blocked cell since 2026-09-10 |
| Final context, files, side effects meet independent expectations | each scenario's assertions, recorded per record; the readiness suites assert files, Git state and the public stream | met |
| No unresolved result, routing, or side-effect difference | the differential decisions and the "Tracked departures" section (none tracked; `interview-run-model-migration` retired) | met |
| Every used feature and temporary form has a disposition | the feature matrix and the milestone D audit above | met |
| Inspection and replay trustworthy; cancellation and timeout leave no leak | `inspect_cli.rs`, `inspect.rs`, the milestone and readiness cancellation cases, `assert_no_leaked_processes`, the "No containers left behind" CI step, replay equal to the live stream (`embedding_readiness`) | met |
| ACP agent backend | the `acp` scenario family of `fabro_scenarios_blackbox` (`acp_turn_and_directive`, `acp_turn_and_directive_docker`, `acp_exit_before_answer_is_retried`, `acp_permission_request_and_hook`, `acp_cancel_during_turn`): a scripted ACP agent (`scenarios/acp/fixtures/scripted_acp_agent.py`, committed into the fixture repository and started by `acp.command` in the run workspace) through the shipped binary on the host and in a Docker container: the turn's text, a routing directive with `context_updates` and `preferred_next_label`, a retry when the agent exits before answering (`max_retries`, two attempts in one firing), a `pre_tool_use` command hook answering `session/request_permission` with the rejecting option plus the `attractor.hook.warning` lines for the boundaries ACP does not offer, and a terminal cancel during a turn (`session/cancel` reaches the agent, nothing leaks). In-process: `petri-attractor-steps::agent` (`an_agent_that_exits_before_answering_is_retried_while_attempts_remain`, `an_agent_that_exits_early_fails_the_stage_routably`), `petri-frontend-fabro::hooks::acp_tool_hooks_are_best_effort_with_explicit_warnings` | claimed for a scripted agent; not claimed: real ACP client products (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) and ACP as a differential cell against the pinned Fabro |
| Additional cutover requirements (Daytona, crash resume) gated separately | out of the initial scope by decision; not claimed | not claimed |

What a passing hosted run shows, in order: "Verify the vendored Fabro
bundles" passes on every job with no fetch and no key; the compatibility job
restores or builds the pinned `fabro` binary and the "Build the pinned fabro
binary" step reports its time; `test:fabro:differential` passes its five
cells; every `check` job writes `coverage.md` to the summary with zero
skipped, missing, and failed required cells; the `fabro-evidence-*`
artifacts exist; `check (ubuntu-24.04)` stays inside its 90-minute budget.
The runs on `67f4cb0`, `97fb247` and `2463979` (2026-09-09) showed this with
one blocked cell, which the matrix declared at the time. Since 2026-09-10
the matrix has no blocked cell, so the next hosted run must show zero, and
the nightly readiness gate enforces that on the Docker runners; no commit
after `2463979` has a hosted run yet.
